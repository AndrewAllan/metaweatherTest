This is the repository for the metaweather test 
Asumptions
1. the first entry returned from the location/woeid/date get method is the high level method for all of london this assumption is derived from the fact that the id matches the object returned for current date at location/woeid 

2. the full api is one feature. As there are multiple methods each of these could in theory be seperate features but for the prupose of this test i have grouped them under the one feature
